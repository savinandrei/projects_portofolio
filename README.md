# Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Science and AI Portfolio!

In this portfolio, I showcase a variety of projects focused on solving real-world problems using data science and artificial intelligence techniques. My work includes end-to-end processes such as data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), building machine learning models, and applying deep learning techniques to tackle complex tasks.

## Skills and Expertise

I specialize in the following areas:

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, outlier detection, feature engineering, and transforming data for machine learning models.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing and analyzing data to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships, using libraries like `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `plotly`.
- **Machine Learning**: Implementing both classification and regression models, including traditional algorithms like Linear Regression, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, and advanced models such as XGBoost and ensemble techniques.
- **Deep Learning**: Developing neural network models using libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch to tackle image, text, and time-series data.
- **Model Evaluation and Tuning**: Using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, RMSE, and R-squared, along with techniques like GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
- **Cloud Platforms**: Familiar with cloud computing environments such as **Microsoft Azure** and **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** for deploying machine learning models and managing data pipelines.

## Projects

Projects in my portofolio are:

- **[Classification & Regression Models](classification&regression_models)**: In this project, I applied various classification and regression models to predict and classify energy consumption data. The models include Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, Random Forests, XGBoost, and more. The project demonstrates how to handle data, train models, evaluate performance, and fine-tune hyperparameters to achieve optimal results.

## Tools and Technologies

I am proficient in the following tools and technologies:

- **Programming Languages**: Python, SQL
- **Libraries and Frameworks**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, XGBoost, Keras, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- **Big Data Framework**: Apache Spark
- **Cloud Platforms**: Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS)
- **Databases**: MySQL, PostgreSQL,
- **Other Tools**: Jupyter Notebooks, Git, Docker, Tableau, Power BI
